**Capstone Project Overview – Cybersecurity, Network Analysis & GRC Alignment**

**1. Project Summary**
This capstone project demonstrates a full range of foundational cybersecurity skills through hands‑on work in virtualization, operating system deployment, ethical penetration testing, and multi‑stage network traffic analysis. The project was completed in a controlled virtual environment and showcases both technical execution and professional SOC‑style reporting. It also highlights competencies that directly support Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) functions, including documentation quality, risk identification, and alignment with security controls.


**2. Virtualization & Operating System Deployment**
- Built and configured multiple virtual machines using VirtualBox.  
- Deployed Linux distributions (including FossaPup) and Windows operating systems.  
- Performed system updates, hard disk allocation, ISO mounting, and environment optimization.  
- Ensured each VM was properly configured for networking, testing, and analysis workflows.

**Purpose:** Establish a secure, isolated environment for penetration testing and packet‑level investigations.

**GRC Relevance:** Demonstrates understanding of secure system configuration, environment hardening, and change‑controlled deployments—key components of compliance frameworks such as NIST, CIS, and ISO 27001.


**3. Ethical Penetration Testing**
- Conducted an ethical penetration test against a deliberately vulnerable server.  
- Identified weaknesses, mapped attack paths, and executed exploitation steps within scope.  
- Documented findings, vulnerabilities, and remediation recommendations.

**Purpose:** Demonstrate practical offensive security skills while following ethical and controlled testing procedures.

**GRC Relevance:** Shows the ability to identify risks, evaluate control weaknesses, and communicate remediation steps—core responsibilities in risk assessments, audit readiness, and compliance reporting.


**4. Wireshark Network Traffic Analysis (Tasks 1002–1006)**
Performed a multi‑stage investigation of captured network traffic to identify malicious behavior and attacker techniques.

Key analysis areas included:
- ARP spoofing indicators  
- DNS anomalies and suspicious domain lookups  
- TCP irregularities and connection attempts  
- HTTP/S traffic inspection  
- Identification of IOCs and attacker behavior patterns  

**Purpose:** Build SOC‑level analytical skills by interpreting packet data, correlating events, and distinguishing malicious from benign traffic.

**GRC Relevance:** Strengthens the ability to validate security controls, detect policy violations, and support incident response documentation—critical for compliance audits and risk governance.


**5. SOC‑Style Reporting & Documentation**
- Produced full technical reports for each task, including methodology, findings, false leads, and mitigation recommendations.  
- Created executive summaries tailored for non‑technical stakeholders.  
- Developed presentation materials outlining key insights and attack narratives.

**Purpose:** Translate technical analysis into clear, actionable intelligence for multiple audiences.

**GRC Relevance:** High‑quality documentation is essential for audit trails, policy alignment, risk registers, and compliance evidence. This project demonstrates the ability to communicate complex issues clearly and professionally.


**6. Skills Demonstrated**
- Virtualization & system deployment  
- Linux & Windows administration  
- Ethical hacking methodology  
- Network traffic analysis (Wireshark)  
- Incident documentation & SOC reporting  
- Technical writing and executive communication  
- **Risk identification, control evaluation, and compliance‑aligned documentation**  
- **Understanding of governance frameworks and security best practices**


**7. How This Project Translates to a GRC Role**
This capstone directly supports GRC responsibilities by demonstrating:

**Risk Awareness & Control Evaluation**
You identified vulnerabilities, mapped attack paths, and assessed the impact—mirroring how GRC analysts evaluate risks and determine whether controls are effective.

**Policy & Framework Alignment**
Your work reflects principles found in:
- NIST CSF  
- NIST 800‑53  
- CIS Controls  
- ISO 27001  

Deploying systems securely, analyzing traffic, and documenting findings all map to real‑world compliance requirements.

**Audit‑Ready Documentation**
Your SOC‑style reports and executive summaries show the ability to:
- Produce evidence for audits  
- Write clear, defensible documentation  
- Communicate risks to leadership  
- Support governance and compliance initiatives  

**Incident Response Governance**
Your packet analysis and attack narratives demonstrate how you would support:
- Incident documentation  
- Root‑cause analysis  
- Post‑incident reporting  
- Control improvement recommendations  

**Cross‑Functional Communication**
GRC roles require translating technical findings into business impact.  
Your project shows you can bridge that gap with clarity and professionalism.
